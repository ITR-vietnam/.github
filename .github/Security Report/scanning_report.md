# Weekly Vulnerability Scan Report

## Introduction  
**Purpose**: This report provides an overview of the security vulnerabilities identified during the vulnerability scans conducted over the past week. The assessment aimed to identify potential security weaknesses within our organization's systems, applications, and networks to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and services.

**Period**: `{{Start_date}}` to `{{End_date}}`

**Scope**: This assessment covers all systems, applications, and networks within the organization.

**Scan Target**: Amazon EC2 instances, container images in Amazon ECR, and Lambda functions.

**Report Time**: `{{ Report_time }}`

**Methodology**:  
The assessment employed the following methodologies:  
- **Scanning Tools**: AWS Inspector  
- **Scan Types**: Automatic scan  
- **Frequency**: Daily (Every 24 hours)  
- **Severity Ratings**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

## Findings  
`{{ Instance_number }}` instances were scanned. A total of `{{ Unique_vulns }}` unique vulnerabilities were found during this scan. Critical, high, medium, and low severity vulnerabilities were found to exist across all `{{ Instance_number }}` systems.

| **Vulnerability Risk**             | **Unique Count** |
|------------------------------------|------------------|
| Critical Severity Vulnerabilities  | `{{ Critical_count }}` |
| High Severity Vulnerabilities      | `{{ High_count }}` |
| Medium Severity Vulnerabilities    | `{{ Medium_count }}` |
| Low Severity Vulnerabilities       | `{{ Low_count }}` |

It is recommended that immediate action be taken to resolve these vulnerabilities by applying patches and adjusting system configurations as necessary.

In addition, a patch and configuration management process should be implemented to continually assess system risk levels as vulnerabilities are discovered. This will ensure that relevant security patches and configurations are applied in a timely manner.

## Risk Assessment  
This report identifies security risks that could have a significant impact on mission-critical applications used in day-to-day business operations. These risks are quantified according to their likelihood of occurrence and the potential damage if they occur. Risk factors are combined to form an overall risk index for each system, allowing you to prioritize your remediation activities accordingly.

A total of `{{ Number_of_Unique_vulnerabilities }}` unique vulnerabilities were found.

### Critical Severity Vulnerabilities  
`{{ Critical_count }}` critical severity vulnerabilities were identified. Critical vulnerabilities require immediate attention. They are relatively easy for attackers to exploit and may provide them with full control of the affected systems.

A list of the most frequent critical severity vulnerabilities is provided below:


| CVE ID      | Description   | Potential Risk  | Current / Fix Version   | Remediation  | Count | Instances Affected | External references |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `{{ CVE_ID }}` | `{{ Description }}` | `{{ Potential_risk }}` | `{{ Current_version }}` / `{{ Fix_Version }}` | `{{ Remediation }}` | `{{ CVE_Count }}` | `{{ Instances_affected }}` | `{{ External references }}` |


### High Severity Vulnerabilities  
`{{ High_count }}` high severity vulnerabilities were identified. High severity vulnerabilities are often harder to exploit and may not provide the same access to affected systems.

A list of the most frequent high severity vulnerabilities is provided below:


| CVE ID      | Description   | Potential Risk  | Current / Fix Version   | Remediation  | Count | Instances Affected | External references |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `{{ CVE_ID }}` | `{{ Description }}` | `{{ Potential_risk }}` | `{{ Current_version }}` / `{{ Fix_Version }}` | `{{ Remediation }}` | `{{ CVE_Count }}` | `{{ Instances_affected }}` | `{{ External references }}` |

### Medium Severity Vulnerabilities  
`{{ Medium_count }}` medium severity vulnerabilities were identified. These vulnerabilities often provide information to attackers that may assist them in mounting subsequent attacks on your network. These should also be fixed in a timely manner but are not as urgent as the other vulnerabilities.

A list of the most frequent medium severity vulnerabilities is provided below:

| CVE ID      | Description   | Potential Risk  | Current / Fix Version   | Remediation  | Count | Instances Affected | External references |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `{{ CVE_ID }}` | `{{ Description }}` | `{{ Potential_risk }}` | `{{ Current_version }}` / `{{ Fix_Version }}` | `{{ Remediation }}` | `{{ CVE_Count }}` | `{{ Instances_affected }}` | `{{ External references }}` |

### Low Severity Vulnerabilities  
`{{ Low_count }}` low severity vulnerabilities were identified. These do not need to be patched immediately and can be resolved during the next update maintenance window.

A list of the most frequent low severity vulnerabilities is provided below:

| CVE ID      | Description   | Potential Risk  | Current / Fix Version   | Remediation  | Count | Instances Affected | External references |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `{{ CVE_ID }}` | `{{ Description }}` | `{{ Potential_risk }}` | `{{ Current_version }}` / `{{ Fix_Version }}` | `{{ Remediation }}` | `{{ CVE_Count }}` | `{{ Instances_affected }}` | `{{ External references }}` |

## Recommendations  
Recommendations in this report are based on the available findings from the credentialed patch audit.

Taking the following actions across `{{ Host_number }}` hosts will resolve `{{ Fix_number }}` vulnerabilities on the system:

| Action to Take         | Number of Vulnerabilities | Number of Hosts |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| `{{ Remediation }}`     | `{{ Vuln_number }}`        | `{{ Host_number }}` |

## Conclusion  
Addressing the identified vulnerabilities is crucial to maintaining a robust security posture. Timely remediation and continuous monitoring will help mitigate potential risks and protect organizational assets.
