# Vulnerability Patching Process Report 

## Introduction
**Purpose**: This report aims to outline the process and progress of patching vulnerabilities identified in the organization’s systems, applications, and networks.

**Scope**: The scope of this report covers vulnerabilities found across all systems, applications, and network devices within the organization, detailing the patching efforts, remediation actions, and future patch management strategies.

**Period**: `{{Start_date}}` to `{{End_date}}`

**Report Time**: `{{ Report_time }}`

## Executive Summary
The vulnerability patching process is being conducted to ensure that all critical and high-priority vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. The overall patching process is broken down into phases: assessment, prioritization, remediation, and verification.

**Patch Process Phases:**
1. **Assessment** – Identification and evaluation of vulnerabilities.
2. **Prioritization** – Categorization of vulnerabilities based on severity.
3. **Remediation** – Applying patches and security fixes.
4. **Verification** – Confirming the effectiveness of patches.

## Patching Status Overview

| **Severity Level**| **Total Vulnerabilities Identified** | **Patched** | **In Progress** | **Pending Patch** | **Not Applicable** |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Critical Severity          | `{{ Critical_total }}`               | `{{ Critical_patched }}` | `{{ Critical_in_progress }}` | `{{ Critical_pending }}` | `{{ Critical_not_applicable }}` |
| High Severity              | `{{ High_total }}`                   | `{{ High_patched }}` | `{{ High_in_progress }}` | `{{ High_pending }}` | `{{ High_not_applicable }}` |
| Medium Severity            | `{{ Medium_total }}`                 | `{{ Medium_patched }}` | `{{ Medium_in_progress }}` | `{{ Medium_pending }}` | `{{ Medium_not_applicable }}` |
| Low Severity               | `{{ Low_total }}`                    | `{{ Low_patched }}` | `{{ Low_in_progress }}` | `{{ Low_pending }}` | `{{ Low_not_applicable }}` |

## Patching Process Details

### 1. **Assessment Phase**
   - **Objective**: Identify and catalog all vulnerabilities across the network.
   - **Method**: Vulnerability scans and audits (e.g., AWS Inspector, Nessus, etc.) were performed to capture vulnerabilities.
   - **Status**: 
     - `{{ Total_vulnerabilities }}` vulnerabilities identified in the latest scan.
     - Each vulnerability was categorized based on severity.

### 2. **Prioritization Phase**
   - **Objective**: Determine which vulnerabilities require immediate attention.
   - **Method**: Vulnerabilities were prioritized using a risk-based approach considering factors like exploitability, impact, and asset criticality.
   - **Status**: 
     - Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities were given top priority.
     - Medium and low-severity vulnerabilities are scheduled for future patches.

### 3. **Remediation Phase**
   - **Objective**: Apply patches, configuration changes, and security fixes.
   - **Method**: 
     - Patch deployment was initiated using [Patch Management Tool].
     - Manual fixes were applied where automatic patching was not feasible.
     - Patches were tested in staging environments before being rolled out to production.
   - **Status**: 
     - `{{ Total_patched }}` vulnerabilities patched.
     - `{{ In_progress_patch }}` vulnerabilities are being patched currently.
     - `{{ Pending_patch }}` vulnerabilities awaiting patching.

### 4. **Verification Phase**
   - **Objective**: Confirm the successful application of patches and validate system integrity.
   - **Method**: 
     - Post-patch scanning was conducted to ensure vulnerabilities were addressed.
     - Continuous monitoring to check for new vulnerabilities.
   - **Status**: 
     - Verification scans showed that `{{ Verified_patched }}` vulnerabilities were successfully patched.
     - `{{ Pending_verification }}` patches are awaiting verification.
